# Discovering Brain Structure with Machine Learning

## Introduction
This repository contains all the information regarding workshop: [Discovering Brain Structure with Machine Learning](https://www.appliedmldays.org/workshop_sessions/discovering-brain-structure-with-machine-learning) that was delivered during the  [Applied Machine Learning Days](https://www.appliedmldays.org) organized at EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland.

The goal of this 3 hours workshop is to faliliarize participants with classic machine learning techniques applied to the brain imaging data.

## Workshop schedule
*note that schedule is the same for both Saturday and Sunday*
